## 🚦 Start here next session — critical!

**Branches:** `main` is the default branch (created 2026-07-01 from what was live in production + Lighthouse a11y fixes). `claude/salon-website-platform-yaa9ya` is historical only — never develop on it. Two open PRs:
- **PR #7** (`academy-phase-7`) — shop (Stage 2), academy commerce (Phase 7), Playwright E2E suite, design-handoff updates, and the full admin redesign (2026-07-03). Not merged.
- **PR #8** (`main-hygiene-a11y-contact`) — a11y/contact/i18n hygiene fixes against `main`. Not merged.

**Database (production Supabase):** all 13 migrations, through `20260703050000_product_inventory_and_activity_log`, are applied and recorded in `_prisma_migrations` with matching checksums (applied directly via the Supabase MCP `apply_migration` tool — the last one, adding `Product.salePriceAgorot/available/featured` + `ActivityLog`, on 2026-07-04, after having been verified only against the isolated local Postgres beforehand: `migrate deploy` clean + `migrate diff` 0 drift). Verified after via direct SQL against `_prisma_migrations` + `information_schema.columns` + `pg_class.relrowsecurity` (RLS on `activity_log` confirmed enabled). **Nothing pending on production anymore.** `prisma migrate` itself cannot reach Supabase from this sandbox (proxy stalls after TCP handshake) — manual/MCP-tool SQL is the standing procedure for any future migration.

**Local test environment:** an isolated PostgreSQL 16 runs at `localhost:5432` (matches `.env.local` `DATABASE_URL`), with a stub `auth` schema so Supabase-dependent migrations apply. Completely separate from production — safe to seed/reset. Used for migration verification and the Playwright E2E suite.

**Other standing facts:** emails go through **Brevo** (not Resend) — contact form + Supabase Auth SMTP, verified end-to-end. Single admin only; role granted manually via `scripts/promote-business-admin.sql` (Phase 8.5 — role-management UI — was explicitly cancelled by the user). Full-repo security review done 2026-06-23 (0 Critical; residual findings in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §7.0`). CI runs on every push.

### Open items that require the user:
1. Real images (hero/gallery/academy/about) — placeholders now.
2. Real accessibility-coordinator name on `/accessibility`.
3. Custom domain — blocks email deliverability (Brevo sends from `@outlook.com`, lands in spam on iCloud) and Apple Sign-In.
4. Native-speaker review of en/ar translations (done by Claude).
5. Confirm Vercel Production Branch was switched to `main` (GitHub default already switched).
6. Merge/review PRs #7 and #8; run the pending PR-#7 migrations on Supabase at merge time.
7. Tranzila: real (sandbox) credentials when ready; `ALLOW_MOCK_CHECKOUT=true` on a preview env to exercise the mock payment flow.

### Session-open checklist:
1. `git status` / `git log -1` — confirm branch vs `origin/main` (or the open feature branch).
2. `npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build` — green before touching anything.
3. Read the latest Session Log entry at the bottom of this file.
4. If `.env.local` is missing in a fresh container — ask the user to re-enter it per `docs/SETUP.md`.

## Vision
Premium barbershop website (menspire.com inspiration). Priorities re-ordered 2026-06-18: the base deliverable is a **marketing site only** (no shop, no user accounts); shop, secure account area, academy commerce, order management, admin and payments are the **optional extension** — activated only when the client chooses it (alternatives compared in [`docs/QUOTE.md`](./docs/QUOTE.md)). The extension **was explicitly approved** by the user on 2026-07-01 (shop) and 2026-07-02 (academy commerce) and is now built.

## Current status summary
- **Base track (marketing site):** complete — home, about, gallery, contact (+form), locations, accessibility widget + statement, privacy/terms, i18n (he/en/ar), SEO, security hardening (4 pentest rounds), Lighthouse pass. Waiting only on user-provided assets (images, domain, coordinator name).
- **Extension track:** shop + checkout + orders (Stage 2), academy course purchases with deposit/balance (Phase 7), and full admin panel — all implemented on `academy-phase-7`/PR #7, awaiting merge + production migrations.
- **Tests:** typecheck + lint + unit (Vitest) + build green; Playwright E2E suite (9 tests: i18n ×3 locales, guest checkout, course enrollment) green.

## Phase 0 — Planning & infrastructure ✅
Stack (Next.js 15/TS/Tailwind/Prisma/Supabase/Vercel), architecture doc, CLAUDE.md, skills (planning/development/qa/security/tranzila-payments/ui-ux), this roadmap.

## Phase 1 — Scaffolding ✅
Next.js 15 + TS strict + Tailwind v4, RTL/Hebrew fonts, ESLint/Prettier, Prisma + `lib/env.ts` (zod) + `lib/db.ts`, Vitest, base layout + design tokens, CI (GitHub Actions), Supabase connected (all early migrations applied manually in SQL Editor), Playwright skeleton (2026-07-02: `playwright.config.ts` + 3 spec files, local webServer on port 3100).

## Phase 2 — Marketing site ✅ (except user-asset items)
Home (hero + all sections), about, gallery, contact (zod + honeypot + server action), locations, SEO (metadata/sitemap/robots). ⬜ Remaining: OG images + final a11y pass — blocked on real images.

## Phase 3 — Auth & account area (extension) ✅ (code)
Supabase Auth (`@supabase/ssr`), middleware protection for `/account`, login/register/forgot/reset/account pages, `auth.callback` route, `handle_new_user` trigger + RLS migration (applied in production 2026-06-23). Security fixes: open-redirect via `?next=` (`safeRedirectPath`), signup honeypot, `prevent_role_change` trigger. Auth pages are deliberately Hebrew-only.

## Stage 2 — Full shop (Phases 4+5+6 combined, approved 2026-07-01) ✅
Plan: [`docs/features/shop.md`](./docs/features/shop.md). Branch `shop-phase-4-5-6` → PR #6.
- ✅ Schema+migrations: Product/Category/Order/OrderItem/Payment + RLS + seed (8 products, 3 categories).
- ✅ Public catalog `/shop`, `/shop/[slug]`; client-side cart (Context+localStorage); checkout with server-side price calculation (`create-order.ts` — client sends only `{productId, quantity}[]`).
- ✅ `PaymentProvider` interface + MockProvider (+ `/checkout/mock-pay`, fail-closed via `ALLOW_MOCK_CHECKOUT`) + TranzilaProvider skeleton (per `tranzila-payments` skill; no real credentials yet); idempotent `handle-payment-result.ts` — stock decremented only on verified payment, amount verified, Brevo confirmation email best-effort.
- ✅ Order history `/account/orders` + guest lookup (`orderNumber` + `guestLookupToken`, generic errors, rate-limited); admin CRUD for products/categories + admin order management with explicit status-transition allow-list; webhook route with `x-webhook-secret` (timingSafeEqual).
- ✅ Security review (3 Low found+fixed) + QA. Money is always integer agorot.
- Decisions: stock decrements only on verified payment; only payment-confirmation email; **tax invoices explicitly deferred** (user has no registered business number yet; invoice provider TBD — placeholder shown in admin as of 2026-07-03).

## Phase 7 — Academy course purchases (approved 2026-07-02) ✅
Branch `academy-phase-7` → PR #7. Deposit = per-course percentage (default 20%); online balance payment; guest+logged-in enrollment; seat capacity. Dedicated `Enrollment`+`CoursePayment` models (shop handler enforces amount==total; enrollment handler verifies against the **specific** payment amount). Course page `/academy/[slug]` (syllabus/details/price/deposit/seats), enroll+pay flow, balance payment with double-charge guard, `/courses/lookup`, `/account/courses`, admin `/admin/enrollments`, webhook routing extended. Migration `20260702000000_academy_commerce` applied on production Supabase + real course prices seeded. ⬜ user-dependent: `ALLOW_MOCK_CHECKOUT` on preview; Tranzila credentials; course content access (video/lessons) is a separate future phase.

## Phase 8 — Admin CMS ✅ (redesigned 2026-07-03)
All content manageable at `/admin` (fixed Hebrew RTL, outside `[locale]`): site settings + opening hours, courses, testimonials, gallery, marketing/legal text blocks (`ContentBlock` merged into next-intl messages in `i18n/request.ts`), products/categories, orders, enrollments. Multilingual fields: Hebrew required, en/ar optional with fallback. `requireAdmin()` (session + role, fail-closed) in layout and in every action. **2026-07-03 redesign:** grouped nav with active state; real dashboard (stats + pending counts); two-step confirm before row deletion; shared form styles; breadcrumbs on nested pages; orders/enrollments search + pagination (previously hard-capped at latest 100 — real bug); `SiteSettings` and `OpeningHour` finally wired to the public site (were dead CRUD); opening hours reduced to locale-neutral `openTime/closeTime/closed` (day names derived via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`); **"Services" feature deleted entirely** (DB + admin + public page + nav) at user request. Phase 8.5 (role management UI) cancelled — single admin via SQL script.

## Phase 8.6 — Admin panel premium redesign ✅
Plan: [`docs/features/admin-redesign.md`](./docs/features/admin-redesign.md). Full rethink (user request 2026-07-03, explicit "do not simply restyle") — SaaS-dashboard-grade (Shopify/Stripe/Linear/Vercel reference), on `academy-phase-7`/PR #7. Key decisions: `Product` gets 3 new independent columns (`salePriceAgorot`, `available`, `featured` — visibility/availability/stock kept as separate axes, also wired into the public shop + `create-order.ts` pricing so they're not cosmetic-only); new cross-entity `ActivityLog` model (append-only audit trail, written alongside the existing `OrderStatusEvent`/`EnrollmentStatusEvent` rather than replacing them); adopted shadcn/ui primitives properly (Badge/Card/Table/Sheet/DropdownMenu/Dialog/Switch/Tooltip/`sonner` toasts — only `Button` existed before); products admin dropped the "submit the whole array, delete whatever's missing" pattern for granular per-field server actions (this was a real latent bug: any row omitted from a resubmit was silently deleted).
- ✅ A — Foundations: sidebar (grouped, collapses to a Sheet on mobile) + topbar (notifications bell w/ pending counts, profile menu) replacing the old single-row header nav; new `src/components/ui/*` primitives; new overlay motion in `globals.css` (data-state-driven, no plugin, respects the existing global `prefers-reduced-motion`).
- ✅ B — Data model: migration `20260703050000_product_inventory_and_activity_log`, verified via `migrate deploy` (13 migrations clean) + `migrate diff` (0 drift) on the isolated local Postgres.
- ✅ C — Products & Inventory: `createProduct`/`updateProductDetails`/`deleteProduct`/`updateProductPrice`/`updateProductSalePrice`/`updateProductStock`/`toggle{Active,Available,Featured}` (each `requireAdmin()`+zod+`ActivityLog`); inline-editable table with stock-health badges (derived, not stored), quick-add Sheet with progressive disclosure, client-side filter/sort/search. Fixed incidentally: `getProducts()` had no tiebreaker on `order` (ties — the default for every new product — sorted non-deterministically between refreshes).
- ✅ D — Orders: stat cards (`getOrdersOverview`), payment-status filter, expandable rows (items/address/timeline) replacing flat link-cards, compact `OrderStatusMenu` (allowed transitions only, `CANCELLED` behind a confirm `Dialog`).
- ✅ E — Course Registrations: identical treatment to D (`getEnrollmentsOverview`, `EnrollmentRow`, `EnrollmentStatusMenu`).
- ✅ F — Activity/History: new `/admin/activity`, unified timeline (icon per entity type, actor, relative time), entity-type filter + search + pagination. `logActivity()` wired into all remaining bulk admin actions (courses/testimonials/gallery/categories/content/site-settings) so every meaningful admin write is now covered from one source.
- ✅ G — Polish + security + QA: `security` skill review (0 Critical/High; added an explicit `z.boolean()` runtime check on the three toggle actions as defense-in-depth, since TS types alone don't guard a direct server-action call); removed `backdrop-blur` from the Sheet/Dialog overlay (harmless simplification, not a fix for anything — a screenshot artifact during testing turned out to be a headless-Chromium quirk with non-fullPage captures at narrow viewports, not a real rendering bug, confirmed by inspecting raw pixel data and by a working `fullPage` capture of the same state). `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.2 documents the redesign's architectural decisions. Verified end-to-end throughout (not just typecheck) against an isolated local Postgres + a temporary local-only auth bypass (reverted before every commit, confirmed via `git diff` each time) — real DB writes, real toasts, real activity-log entries, mobile nav Sheet confirmed working via `fullPage` screenshot. `npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build` all green throughout.

**Still pending (user-dependent, same as the rest of PR #7):** production Supabase migration not yet run — `20260703050000_product_inventory_and_activity_log` joins the other pending PR-#7 migrations, all applied together at merge time (see "Start here next session" above).

## Phase 9 — Restyle app link (booking) ✅
No booking system on the site — "Book now" CTAs deep-link to the Restyle app (`BookingLink`: Android→Google Play, else App Store), URLs now editable via admin SiteSettings.

## Phase 12 — Admin shortcut in the account area ✅
User request: show an "Admin Panel" shortcut on `/account` for admins only, convenience-only (not a security boundary). New `src/lib/auth/current-user.ts` — `getCurrentUser()`, a non-redirecting sibling to `requireAdmin()` (same Supabase-session → Prisma-role lookup pattern, reused rather than duplicated) — used by `account/page.tsx` to conditionally render a `ShieldCheck`-icon `Link` to `/admin` (styled with the existing `buttonVariants({variant:"outline"})`, matching the "My courses" button). Caught and fixed one real bug while building: used the i18n-aware `Link` from `@/i18n/navigation` at first, which would have prefixed `/admin` with the locale (e.g. `/en/admin`) — `/admin` lives outside `[locale]` (see `middleware.ts` `NON_LOCALIZED_PREFIXES`), so switched to plain `next/link`. `security` skill review: 0 Critical/High — role check is server-rendered only (no client-side bypass surface), scoped to the caller's own session (no IDOR), and `/admin` access stays fully gated by the untouched `requireAdmin()` + middleware regardless of the button. Verified visually against local Postgres with two seeded test users (ADMIN/USER): admin sees the button, regular user doesn't, and a regular user hitting `/admin` directly still gets redirected away by `requireAdmin()`. All gates green.

## Phase 11 — PWA (two separate installable apps) ✅
Plan: [`docs/features/pwa.md`](./docs/features/pwa.md). User request 2026-07-03: PWA for both the public site and the admin panel. Since `[locale]` and `admin` are two independent `<html>` trees (no shared root `layout.tsx`), these are two separate installed apps, not one PWA with modes — separate manifest, icons, and service worker each, on purpose. Key decisions: static `public/*.webmanifest` files (not `app/manifest.ts` — nested-segment support for that convention isn't confirmed, and a leaked manifest between the two apps is a real risk not worth the convenience); `serwist`/`@serwist/next` for the service workers rather than hand-rolled fetch routing (this site has auth/payments/admin — a caching bug here is a security/correctness risk, and a declarative per-route-pattern config is easier to audit than manual `if` branches); strict `NetworkOnly` for `/cart`, `/checkout*`, `/account/*`, `/courses/*`, `/api/*`, `/auth/*`, and all of `/admin/*` (never cached), `NetworkFirst` for `/shop*` (real prices), `StaleWhileRevalidate` for static marketing pages, `CacheFirst` only for immutable `/_next/static/*` assets. Admin icon set is color-inverted from the public one so the two installed apps are visually distinguishable on a home screen/task switcher.
- ✅ Group 1 — Icons + manifests (Playwright-rendered from the existing `icon.svg` mark; `metadata.manifest` wired per layout; iOS meta tags)
- ✅ Group 2 — Service workers (serwist config, two SWs with distinct scopes, registration per layout, CSP `worker-src`/`manifest-src`); real bug found+fixed along the way: next-intl's middleware was 404-ing `/sw.js`/`*.webmanifest` (not in its static-file exclusion list), fixed via the middleware matcher.
- ✅ Group 3 — `security` skill review found 2 real gaps, both fixed before close-out: (1) **High** — `/courses/success` and `/courses/cancel` are `force-dynamic` pages that render live enrollment status/number and payment balance from the DB, but weren't in the never-cache list, so they fell through to the broad marketing-pages `StaleWhileRevalidate` rule — meaning payment/PII data would land in Cache Storage on a shared device, the exact risk `/cart`/`/checkout`/`/account` were already excluded for. Fixed by adding `courses` to the never-cache path list in `src/app/sw.ts`. (2) **Medium** — the middleware's static-asset bypass matched by file extension anywhere in the URL (`.*\.(?:svg|png|...)$`), which would have silently skipped the session check for any *future* `/admin/*` or `/account/*` route ending in one of those extensions (an image proxy, a CSV/XML export), leaving only the in-handler `requireAdmin()` layer standing — a defense-in-depth regression. Fixed by scoping the bypass to the actual static paths (`icons/`, `images/`, named root files) instead of a global extension match. Both fixes re-verified: full quality gates green (`tsc` incl. worker tsconfig, lint, `npm test`), and a live dev-server curl pass confirming all static assets (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `*.webmanifest`, `icons/*`, `images/*`, `icon.svg`) still resolve 200 and `/admin`+`/account` still redirect to `/login` without a session.

## Phases 13-18 — Platform upgrade: account area + admin (epic) ✅ completed 2026-07-06
Resumed same day as the pause. Schema migration for wishlist+addresses applied
(production + local-verified, 0 drift). M1 and M2 both implemented by parallel Sonnet
agents in isolated worktrees, each reviewed line-by-line by the orchestrator before
merge (diff scoped exactly to its brief, tsc/lint/test/build re-verified independently,
plus live Playwright verification against the local DB for M1). Both fast-forward
merged and pushed.
Master plan: [`docs/features/platform-upgrade.md`](./docs/features/platform-upgrade.md)
(+ 4 analysis briefs in `docs/features/platform-upgrade/`). User request 2026-07-04:
Shopify/Stripe-class management experience, mandated multi-agent workflow (4 Opus
analysis agents done → parallel Sonnet implementation per milestone → Opus review wave).
Locked decisions: single admin stays; curriculum/video skipped; invoices deferred;
promotion engine full-but-staged (A: coupons+percent/fixed+free-shipping; B: BXGY/
bundles/time-based later).
- ✅ **Phase 13 (M1)** — Account transformation: new `account/layout.tsx` consolidating
  the auth-redirect that was duplicated across 4 pages, RTL sidebar (desktop, `border-s`
  opposite of admin's `border-e` — content is DOM-first for a11y, nav visually first via
  `order-*`) + 5-tab mobile bottom bar with a "עוד" overflow `Sheet`, full `account` i18n
  namespace (he/en/ar). Dashboard rebuilt as independently-`Suspense`-streamed cards
  (recent orders, profile-completion nudge, courses, quick actions, wishlist preview,
  recommended/recently-viewed rails) with every empty state per spec. `updateProfile`
  action + `/account/profile` (name/phone editable, email read-only, links to the
  existing reset-password flow — no new password UI). Wishlist: idempotent DB-truth
  toggle (`WishlistItem`, race-safe via P2002) + heart button on `ProductCard` +
  `/account/wishlist` with optimistic remove/undo. Address book: full CRUD, single-default
  invariant enforced transactionally against the partial-unique index, IDOR-guarded
  (every mutation re-checks `existing.userId !== userId`, same pattern as order-detail
  ownership). **Orchestrator integration review caught 3 real bugs the agent's own
  tsc/lint/test/build pass couldn't** (live Playwright verification against the local DB
  is what surfaced them): (1) **crash** — the server layout passed bare Lucide icon
  *component references* as a prop into a `"use client"` nav component; React rejects
  unrendered function/forwardRef values crossing the Server→Client boundary
  ("Functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components") — `/account` 500'd in
  a live run despite type-checking fine. Fixed by moving the href→icon map into the
  client component itself (matching the existing admin sidebar-nav pattern), passing
  only strings down. (2) **day-theme contrast** — the shared `Card` primitive
  (`bg-ink-soft/60`) and two dashboard cards' inner rows (`bg-ink/40`) use
  opacity-modified token variants that the site's `[data-theme="day"]` override rules
  didn't cover (only the non-opacity class was themed) — `Card` was built for the
  always-dark admin panel and M1 is its first consumer under the theme-aware public
  site, so this never surfaced before. Added the missing day-mode overrides. (3)
  **mobile layout collision** — the new fixed bottom tab bar overlapped the site's
  pre-existing floating WhatsApp/phone/accessibility buttons (measured via real bounding
  boxes, not visible in a static screenshot) — added a stable `data-account-mobile-nav`
  attribute + a `:has()` CSS rule (media-matched to the `md:hidden` breakpoint) that
  raises the floating buttons only when the account tab bar is actually in the DOM,
  with zero changes to the site-wide (Server Component) floating-contact component.
  Also completed the `ConfirmDialog` promotion to `components/ui/` that the agent had
  deliberately left as a flagged temporary duplicate (couldn't touch `admin/**` while
  a sibling agent worked there in parallel) — deleted the admin copy, repointed its 3
  importers. `tsc`/lint/34 tests/production build all green after every fix; live
  end-to-end address creation verified against the local DB (day/night, RTL/EN,
  desktop/mobile).
- ✅ **Phase 14 (M2)** — Admin dashboard v2: `getDashboardOverview()` (today/7d/30d
  revenue with prior-period delta, AOV, customers count, low-stock count, 30-day daily
  series, top-5 products) built on pure/tested helpers (`dashboard-metrics.ts`,
  25 vitest cases) layered over the existing `getOrdersOverview`-style revenue
  definition (extracted to a shared `NON_REVENUE_ORDER_STATUSES` constant instead of
  duplicating it). Two hand-rolled monochrome SVG charts — revenue bars (own
  `overflow-x-auto`, page body never scrolls) and top-products horizontal bars anchored
  to the RTL-correct right edge regardless of DOM direction — both with the "little/zero
  data" states specced (never looks broken on a near-empty shop). Activity feed embedded
  via the existing `ActivityTimeline` (`limit` param added, no parallel query). Topbar's
  per-navigation query lightened to a 2-count `getTopbarAlertCounts()` instead of the
  full heavy aggregator. Notification-center persistence deferred to its own migration
  (M5/M6) as planned — bell untouched. `tsc`/lint/25 tests/production build all green.
- ✅ **Phase 15 (M3)** — Catalog: products bulk actions (activate/deactivate/feature/
  delete) + duplicate + preview + SEO/publishAt (Asia/Jerusalem⇄UTC helper, DST-safe);
  categories + courses converted from single-form editors to table views with granular
  server actions (create/update/delete/duplicate/toggle/reorder), counts (`_count`),
  and their own SEO/publishAt Sheets. All 3 streams built in parallel Sonnet worktrees,
  reviewed and merged individually (tsc/lint/test/build green at each step, plus a
  final integration check after all three landed).
- ✅ **Phase 16 (M4)** — Promotion engine Stage A + coupons. 3 streams: (1) pure
  evaluator (`src/lib/promotions/evaluate.ts`, 28/28 vitest cases matching the
  spec's exact worked examples — round-once half-up, largest-remainder line
  allocation, best-single-auto-promo + coupon-on-top-of-post-auto-subtotal
  stacking, orthogonal free shipping); (2) admin CRUD for promotions/coupons
  (create/edit/eligibility-by-product-or-category, bulk coupon-code generation
  with crypto randomness + collision retry); (3) real checkout integration —
  `create-order.ts` now wraps order creation in one `db.$transaction`, locks
  the coupon row `FOR UPDATE` before counting usage, hard-fails the whole
  checkout on a rejected coupon (never silent full-price fallback), and
  releases the redemption (decrement `usedCount`, delete `CouponRedemption`)
  on payment FAILED/amount-mismatch and admin order cancellation — never on
  SUCCEEDED. Orchestrator independently re-verified the concurrency claim
  (5 simultaneous checkouts against a `usageLimit:1` coupon → exactly 1
  succeeds) and the release-on-FAILED claim against a live local Postgres,
  using the real evaluator/fetch/handler code, not a reimplementation. Passed
  through both `security` and `tranzila-payments` skill reviews before merge
  (0 Critical/High; a couple of Low/informational notes on coupon-preview
  error-message granularity and email plus-addressing, both accepted
  pre-existing tradeoffs). No customer-facing coupon `<input>` exists yet in
  the cart/checkout UI — flagged as follow-up, not a defect (backend is fully
  wired, `applyCouponPreview` ready to consume).
- ✅ **Phase 17 (M5)** — Inventory: InventoryEvent ledger, low-stock alerts everywhere,
  adjustment dialog, per-product history drawer. Schema (migration
  `20260706150000_inventory_events`: InventoryEvent + InventoryReason enum +
  SiteSettings.lowStockThreshold, RLS Pattern B). Write points wired and
  orchestrator-verified against a live DB: `updateProductStock` (RESTOCK/
  MANUAL_ADJUST, reads current stock inside its own transaction so it can't
  clobber a concurrent SALE decrement) and `handle-payment-result`'s SUCCEEDED
  branch (SALE, one event per line item, `resultingStock` snapshot — required
  converting that transaction from array-form to an interactive callback).
  Admin UI: stock-adjustment Sheet (set-absolute or +/- delta mode, both
  routing through the one verified `updateProductStock` write point — no
  parallel mutation action), per-product inventory-history drawer (reasons in
  Hebrew, delta color-coded, links to the order when one is attached), and the
  real DB-backed low-stock threshold now wired into the dashboard KPI and
  product-table badges/filters (was a hardcoded constant, kept only as
  fallback).
- ✅ **Phase 18 (M6)** — Settings tabs (incl. editable shipping fee), UX polish pass,
  final Opus review wave (architecture/security/a11y/responsive/performance) + QA.
  Settings reorganization: `/admin/settings` rebuilt into a 3-tab IA per
  ux-spec §B6 (כללי ופרטי קשר / שעות פתיחה / משלוח ומלאי — "התראות" tab excluded,
  its data model doesn't exist yet), `?tab=` deep-linkable, unsaved-changes
  guard (new pattern, none existed in the codebase before), shipping fee +
  low-stock threshold now editable and wired all the way through to checkout
  (`getShippingFeeAgorot()`, orchestrator-verified fallback-to-constant when no
  settings row exists yet). Customer-facing coupon input shipped (closing a
  real gap against the master acceptance criteria, not just polish — "preview
  in cart" was explicitly required): manual apply-button UX in the checkout
  form, live non-authoritative preview via `applyCouponPreview`, applied code
  passed through to `createOrder` on submit. Final Opus review wave completed
  against the accumulated M1-M6 whole (not re-litigating already-reviewed
  pieces): found the epic in strong shape overall (security/money/a11y/RTL
  clean across the board) with 2 High findings — both around acceptance
  criterion 6 (low-stock surfacing) — fixed: the dashboard's low-stock KPI
  linked to a dead `?stock=low` filter the products table never read, and the
  notification bell wasn't wired to low stock at all despite the criterion
  explicitly requiring "dashboard + bell." Also fixed 2 Medium findings
  (uncapped coupon/redemption list queries on the promotion detail page —
  same unbounded-growth risk the inventory-history query had already guarded
  against, now capped at 200/50) and 2 of 4 Low polish items (coupon codes
  forced `dir:ltr` so mixed-format codes don't reorder in an RTL cell;
  promotions moved to their own "שיווק" nav group). Two Low items deliberately
  left as documented follow-up, not fixes: promotions-table status
  chips/filtering (a real feature addition, not a fix) and a chart-tooltip
  misalignment when horizontally scrolled (desktop-hover-only, cosmetic).

## Stages 1/1.1/1.2 — Marketing completion ✅
Accessibility widget + `/accessibility` statement (IS 5568 / WCAG 2.0 AA), `/academy` content page, `/locations`, quick-contact buttons (floating WhatsApp/phone + Waze/tel/WhatsApp rows, `contact-links.ts` single source), `/privacy` + `/terms`, favicon, real brand logo asset, Brevo email verified in production, Lighthouse pass (a11y/BP 100, perf 88-95, SEO 100 after `force-static` fix on 6 pages).

## Stage 2 (earlier) — i18n (he/en/ar) ✅
`next-intl`, Hebrew default without prefix, `/en` + `/ar`, RTL/LTR handling, LocaleSwitcher, per-locale sitemap with hreflang, E2E-verified. Note: en/ar translations were machine-written — native review pending (user item). Known residual bug: `about`/`accessibility` still use sync `useTranslations()` with `force-static` → body renders Hebrew on /en `/ar` (all other affected pages were converted to async 2026-07-03).

## Phase 10 — Hardening & launch ⬜
- ⬜ Final comprehensive security pass + rate-limit upgrade (Vercel KV) + Next 16 migration
- ⬜ Performance/a11y/E2E final sweep with real images
- ⬜ Backups, monitoring, logging
- ⬜ Domain + production deploy sign-off

## Phase 20 — Product page dark-mode fix + coupon system simplification 🔄
User request: (1) the "Add to Cart" button's circular pill container is invisible in
dark/night mode on the product page; (2) the coupon system (built in M4/Phase 16) is too
complex — creating a simple `friends10`-style 10%-off code forces the merchant through a
two-model "create a Promotion, then add a Coupon under it" flow with many irrelevant fields
(appliesTo, priority, stackable, per-customer limits, bulk-code generation). Wants a flat,
simple coupon form (code/discount type/value/active) with an optional advanced section
(expiration/min order/max usage/product exclusions), and a genuinely new capability: coupons
that apply to everything **except** explicitly excluded products, with clear cart-mixed-item
behavior. User confirmed via `AskUserQuestion` that course-coupon integration is out of
scope for now (courses have zero discount support today, a separate purchase pipeline
`Enrollment`/`CoursePayment` — wiring coupons into it is a bigger, separate future effort).

**A. Dark-mode button root cause (real bug, not cosmetic-only).** `buttonVariants`'s
`primary` variant has a CSS-var background hardcoded to `#0e0e0e` (`--btn-primary-bg`,
identical in both themes) — this is by design a *dark pill for light backgrounds*, per the
component's own doc comment. In night/dark theme, the page background (`--page-bg`) is ALSO
`#0e0e0e` — so any button using the default variant directly on the page background is
functionally invisible (the pill is there, just indistinguishable from the page). The
`light` variant is the theme-adaptive one already used correctly everywhere else on dark
surfaces (header, login/register, home CTAs) — white pill in night, dark pill in day
(`--btn-light-bg` flips per theme). `AddToCartButton` (the reported bug) and 13 other
call sites across checkout/cart/gallery/lookup/courses pages have the exact same
default-variant-on-dark-surface bug — same root cause, same one-line fix.

**B. Coupon architecture.** DB check confirms this is effectively greenfield for the admin
redesign: exactly one `Promotion`+`Coupon` pair exists in production (`Friends10`, already a
clean 1:1 case), no automatic (no-code) promotions in use, no multi-coupon campaigns — no
risky data migration needed. Keep the existing `Promotion`/`Coupon`/`CouponRedemption`
schema and the evaluator's atomic-locking design (correct, tested, 28 vitest cases) entirely
intact — this is an additive, UI-layer simplification, not a schema rewrite. New capability
needed: exclusion. Today `eligibleProductIds`/`eligibleCategoryIds` are INCLUSIVE-only (empty
= applies to everything, non-empty = ONLY those) — there's no way to express "everything
except X." Add one new additive table, `PromotionExcludedProduct` (mirrors the existing
`PromotionProduct` M2M), and thread `excludedProductIds` through `PromotionRow` in the pure
evaluator (`evaluate.ts`) — a line is coupon-eligible iff included AND not excluded. The
existing `COUPON_NO_ELIGIBLE_ITEMS` rejection path already produces exactly the "cart
contains only excluded items → coupon doesn't apply, clear reason shown" behavior once
exclusion is wired in; the existing `eligibleLinesFor`/largest-remainder allocation already
guarantees "mixed cart → discount only on eligible lines" for free. What's new UI-side:
checkout must render which line items received the discount (today `EvalResult.lineDiscounts`
is computed and even persisted per-`OrderItem`, but never surfaced in the pre-purchase
checkout UI) — needs a small itemized cart summary added to checkout.

**Admin UX redesign.** New flat `/admin/coupons` page: one row = one coupon (code, discount
summary, usage count, active toggle). New Sheet: **basic** fields only shown by default
(code, discount type percent/fixed, value, active) — **advanced** section (collapsible,
closed by default, matching the existing `CollapsibleSection` pattern from
`promotion-edit-sheet.tsx`) holds expiration date, minimum order value, max usage limit, and
the new excluded-products picker (reusing the existing `CheckboxList` + `getEligibilityOptions`
pattern). Under the hood, one server action creates/updates the Promotion+Coupon pair
together in a single transaction — the merchant never sees "two models." The existing
`/admin/promotions` page (automatic sitewide campaigns, bulk-code generation) is left fully
intact and reachable for power users — nothing removed, per "preserve existing
functionality"; the new page is simply the recommended, simple primary path for the common
case, added as its own "קופונים" sidebar entry above "מבצעים אוטומטיים" (renamed for clarity
now that the two are separate surfaces). Fields deliberately NOT exposed in the new simple
form (available only via the legacy advanced flow): per-customer limit, priority, stackable,
appliesToSaleItems, appliesTo, automatic, category-level eligibility, bulk-code generation —
matching the user's explicit "should not require assigning to users / limiting number of
users / generating additional codes."

**Acceptance criteria:**
1. Add-to-cart button (and the 13 other same-bug instances) has a clearly visible pill
   container in both night and day theme — verified via live `getComputedStyle()` reads, not
   screenshots alone.
2. Admin can create a working 10%-off coupon (`friends10`) in one form, four fields, no
   forced extra configuration.
3. Advanced settings (expiration/min order/max usage/exclusions) are available but never
   forced during basic creation.
4. A coupon with an excluded product: cart of only-excluded-items → coupon does not apply,
   customer sees a clear reason; cart of mixed items → discount applies only to eligible
   lines; checkout visibly shows which line(s) got the discount.
5. Existing `Friends10` coupon and its evaluator/redemption/atomicity guarantees keep working
   unchanged; `/admin/promotions` (automatic campaigns, bulk generation) unaffected.
6. `tsc`/lint/tests (including new exclusion evaluator cases)/build green throughout; no
   money computed client-side; `security` + `tranzila-payments` skill review before shipping
   (touches the checkout evaluator data path).

**Task breakdown:** (a) fix the 14-instance dark-mode button bug directly (mechanical,
`variant="light"`); (b) migration for `PromotionExcludedProduct` (additive); (c) evaluator +
`fetch-promotion-data.ts` exclusion wiring + new vitest cases; (d) new simple-coupon admin
schema/actions/UI; (e) checkout per-line discount display; (f) `security`+`tranzila-payments`
review since the evaluator/checkout data path changed; (g) QA (gates + live Playwright
end-to-end coupon flow against local Postgres) + ROADMAP close-out. All done by the
orchestrator directly (no worktree agents) — the pieces are tightly coupled (schema →
evaluator → admin UI → checkout all depend on the same new `excludedProductIds` shape) and
touch checkout-adjacent code, which this project's established pattern keeps
orchestrator-owned rather than delegated.

## Phase 19 — Premium UX & trust polish ✅
User request: elevate course registration to a premium/luxury feel, fix a real pricing-
transparency gap, add a clear header "Personal Area" entry point, audit+fix admin mobile
responsiveness site-wide, and audit+fix color contrast site-wide. Analysis done before any
code (per `planning` skill):

**A. Course registration premium redesign + pricing transparency (real bug, not just
polish).** Current state read directly: `academy/[slug]/page.tsx` shows the course's full
price as the dominant accent-colored headline number (labeled "מחיר מלא" — technically not
false, but visually dominant), with the deposit relegated to a small secondary line below.
The **catalog card** (`academy/page.tsx`) already does this correctly — "החל מ-" (starting
from) + the deposit amount as the headline. The detail page needs the same "starting from
deposit" framing as the primary number, with the full price shown as a clearly-labeled
secondary total, so a user scanning the detail page can never mistake the deposit for the
one-time price or the full price for what's due today. `EnrollForm` itself is a bare,
unstyled HTML form (plain radio inputs, no visual hierarchy, no trust signals) — needs a
premium redesign built on the existing `Card`/`Badge` primitives (already used by M1/M2, not
reinventing a new visual language), clearer deposit-vs-full-price framing inside the plan
selector itself (not just at page-load), and trust elements (secure-payment messaging,
step/progress framing) around the actual payment handoff. Server-side price computation
(`create-enrollment.ts`, already fully re-derives everything from the DB, ignores client-
sent price) is untouched — this is presentation-layer only, no server action contract
changes.

**B. Header "Personal Area" access.** Current state: `AccountIconLink` is icon-only (no
text label), hidden entirely on mobile (`hidden md:flex`) — on mobile it's only reachable
buried at the bottom of the hamburger-menu link list, styled identically to ordinary nav
links (About/Shop/Academy/...), not visually distinguished as an account action. Needs a
clearly-labeled "אזור אישי" entry visible on both desktop (upgrade the icon to icon+label,
or a distinct treatment) and mobile (promote out of the plain link list into its own
visually-distinct placement, e.g. alongside the existing bottom action row with
theme/locale toggles), integrated into the existing premium visual language (not a bolted-on
generic button).

**C+D. Admin mobile audit + site-wide color/contrast audit (combined into one analysis
pass to avoid re-reading the same component tree twice).** Root cause already confirmed for
D: the day/night theme system (`globals.css`) works by hardcoding CSS overrides for a
**finite enumerated list** of specific Tailwind classes (`.text-neutral-300/400/500`,
`.bg-ink-soft/60`, `.bg-ink/40`, `.border-line-dark`, `.text-accent`, etc.) — any component
using a color utility class outside that exact list (e.g. a stray `text-neutral-200`,
`border-accent/40`, or a semantic color like `text-red-400`/`text-green-400` used on a
surface that flips light in day mode) silently keeps its dark-mode value and can become
invisible or low-contrast in day theme. This exact bug class was already caught once this
session (M1's Card component) — the admin's 6 milestones of new UI built this session
(promotions/coupons tables, settings tabs, inventory dialogs, stock-adjust sheets) are newer
than that fix and haven't been individually re-audited for the same failure mode. For C
(mobile), admin was originally designed desktop-first in Phase 8.6 with a retrofitted mobile
drawer nav — individual newer admin surfaces (wide tables, multi-column bulk-action bars,
Sheets with side-by-side fields) need per-screen verification, not an assumption that the
shared `Table`/`Sheet` primitives make every consumer automatically mobile-safe.

**Acceptance criteria:**
1. Course detail page's dominant, most visually prominent price number is the deposit
   ("starting from X"), never the full price alone; the full course total is always shown,
   clearly labeled, and never presented as what's due today.
2. `EnrollForm` reads as a premium, trustworthy multi-step-feeling experience (visual
   hierarchy, spacing, the existing Card/Badge language, explicit deposit-vs-total framing
   inside the plan selector, payment-security trust copy) — not a bare HTML form.
3. A "Personal Area" entry with a visible Hebrew label is reachable in ≤1 tap/click on both
   mobile and desktop, styled consistently with the rest of the premium header.
4. Every admin screen (products, categories, courses, promotions/coupons, orders,
   enrollments, settings, activity, dashboard) is usable at a small mobile viewport: no
   horizontal page scroll, every actionable control has an adequate tap target, wide tables
   have an explicit mobile-safe presentation (not just relying on generic overflow-scroll).
5. No text/icon/border becomes invisible or low-contrast in either theme, on any surface
   touched by this session's admin work or the public site; day/night parity holds.
6. `tsc`/lint/tests/build green throughout; no server action contracts changed for area A
   (money still computed server-side only); existing functionality (enrollment creation,
   payment flow, header nav links) fully preserved.

**Task breakdown:** (a) Opus audit agent — read-only pass across all admin screens (mobile
viewport reasoning) + site-wide color-token usage, producing a prioritized findings doc,
same rigor as M6's final review wave; (b) orchestrator builds the header Personal Area
entry directly (small, self-contained); (c) orchestrator designs+builds the course
registration premium redesign directly (the epic's centerpiece, invoking the `ui-ux` skill
first); (d) triage the audit findings from (a) into fix batches, building the critical ones
directly and delegating larger mechanical batches to Sonnet agents in isolated worktrees,
mirroring the platform-upgrade epic's proven review→merge pipeline.

**Status: ✅ done.** (a) Opus audit completed, produced findings D1–D7 (contrast) and
C1–C4 (admin mobile). (b) Header Personal Area entry built — desktop pill with icon+label
(`AccountNavLink`, renamed from `AccountIconLink`), mobile promoted to its own full-width
button below the nav list (`mobile-nav.tsx`), no longer buried in the plain link list. (c)
Course registration redesign built — `academy/[slug]/page.tsx` now shows the deposit as the
dominant headline number with the full price as a clearly-labeled secondary total (the
actual pricing-transparency bug fix); `EnrollForm` rebuilt on `Card`/Badge-style plan
selector cards with `react-hook-form` `watch()`-driven active-state styling, deposit-vs-
total breakdown per plan, and secure-payment trust copy. (d) Audit findings triaged and
fixed directly (mechanical, low-risk, no agent delegation needed):
- **D1** (High) — `dropdown-menu.tsx` `text-neutral-200` → `text-neutral-300` (2 places);
  was invisible in day theme on the account-address actions menu.
- **D4** (Medium) — `wishlist-heart-button.tsx` `text-white` → `text-[#fff]` (arbitrary
  value bypasses the day-theme override selector, since the circle behind it is
  intentionally dark in both themes); was an invisible dark-heart-on-dark-circle bug.
- **D6** (Low, preventive) — `badge.tsx` neutral tone `text-neutral-200` → `text-neutral-300`.
- **C1** (High-leverage, mechanical) — 12 unprefixed `grid grid-cols-2` instances across 6
  admin edit Sheets/Dialogs (`promotion-edit-sheet.tsx`, `coupon-edit-sheet.tsx`,
  `course-edit-sheet.tsx` ×5, `product-edit-sheet.tsx`, `generate-coupons-dialog.tsx` ×2)
  → `grid-cols-1 gap-3 sm:grid-cols-2`, matching the pattern already used correctly by
  `testimonials-form.tsx`/`gallery-form.tsx`; fields were crushing 2-up at 375px.

Deliberately **not** fixed, accepted as documented follow-ups (all Low severity, no user-
facing breakage, avoids scope-creeping a "premium polish" epic into every Low finding):
- **C2** — products page's floating bulk-action bar wraps awkwardly + small tap targets on
  narrow mobile (`products-table.tsx:484-515`).
- **C3** — products table's 9-column layout requires heavy horizontal scroll on mobile；
  explicit judgment call, no mobile-card fallback built (would be a real redesign, not a
  polish fix).
- **C4** — Dialog/Sheet content can go edge-to-edge on mobile and some tall Sheets lack
  `overflow-y-auto` (`dialog.tsx:34`, `sheet.tsx`).
- **D5** — colored status badges (`order-status-badge.tsx`, `enrollment-status-badge.tsx`)
  look "muddy" in day mode but remain legible — cosmetic only.
- **D7** — several other `text-neutral-200`/`bg-ink/NN` usages reviewed individually and
  confirmed correct as-is (surfaces that stay dark in both themes, e.g.
  `account-mobile-nav.tsx`, `product-card.tsx`) — explicitly a global CSS-rule fix was
  rejected here because it would have broken these correct cases; targeted per-component
  fixes were used instead for D1/D4/D6.

All fixes gated: `tsc --noEmit`, `next lint`, `vitest` (94 tests), `next build` — all clean
after every commit. Contrast fixes additionally live-verified via Playwright with explicit
theme/locale forcing and `getComputedStyle()` reads (not screenshots alone).

## Session Log

> Entries before 2026-07-03 are in [`docs/archive/ROADMAP-hebrew.md`](./docs/archive/ROADMAP-hebrew.md) (Hebrew, verbatim). Write new entries in English, most recent last.

| Date | What was done | Next |
|------|----------------|------|
| 2026-07-02 | Playwright E2E infrastructure on `academy-phase-7`: config + isolated local Postgres 16 (stub `auth` schema so all migrations apply), seeded e2e rows, 3 specs (i18n ×3 locales / guest checkout / course enrollment with deposit) — 9/9 green. `ALLOW_MOCK_CHECKOUT` only in the test webServer env. | Merge PR #7 per user. |
| 2026-07-03 | Design-handoff implementation (from Claude Design export): locations page hours block + live "open now" badge + 4 quick-contact tiles; asymmetric testimonials layout on home (lead quote + 2 side quotes, new optional `role` field on Testimonial + migration); Instagram CTA on gallery (real handle `@avraham.hairartist`). Found+fixed pre-existing i18n bug (force-static + sync hooks renders Hebrew on en/ar) on `locations`. All gates + Playwright green. | Fix same i18n bug on about/accessibility later. |
| 2026-07-03 | **Admin redesign, 5 groups** (each committed+pushed separately to PR #7): (0) deleted "Services" feature entirely; (1) OpeningHour simplified to locale-neutral fields, single source of truth for home/locations/OpenNowBadge, admin form 42→21 inputs; (2) SiteSettings wired to the public site (was 100% dead CRUD) — contact details/Instagram/app links now DB-driven with `siteConfig` fallback, converted remaining force-static pages to async (fixing the i18n bug on contact/privacy/terms); (3) grouped admin nav + real dashboard + two-step delete confirmation + breadcrumbs + shared form styles; (4) orders/enrollments search + pagination (fixed real bug: rows beyond latest 100 were unreachable). `facebookUrl` left unwired and `Course.level*` left trilingual — both per explicit user decision. All gates green; Playwright 9/9 after removing deleted `/services` from the i18n spec. Migrations pending on production Supabase (run at PR-#7 merge). | Continue with next user request. |
| 2026-07-03 | **ROADMAP switched to English + admin comfort round 2** (user request). (a) ROADMAP rewritten in English, Hebrew history archived at `docs/archive/ROADMAP-hebrew.md`, rule anchored in CLAUDE.md. (b) **Slugs removed from admin entirely** — auto-generated server-side (`lib/admin/slug.ts`), row identity switched from slug to id in products/categories/courses actions (delete-first transaction so new rows survive), existing slugs stay stable. (c) **Image upload from device** — `/api/admin/upload` (admin-only 401/403, magic-byte sniffing not declared Content-Type, 5MB cap, random filenames) → Supabase Storage public bucket `site-images` (auto-created on first use); upload button in gallery+products forms, URL paste kept as fallback. Live upload NOT testable in this sandbox (`.env.local` has dummy Supabase URL) — verify once on Vercel preview. (d) **Status history** — new `OrderStatusEvent`/`EnrollmentStatusEvent` models (migration `20260703040000_status_events`, pending on production Supabase like the other PR-#7 migrations): every transition recorded (system/payment/admin-email) and shown to the admin (detail-page timelines) and to the client (order detail in account + guest lookup). Verified end-to-end via the E2E flows against local DB. (e) **Dashboard** — orders & enrollments count breakdown per status (each row links to the filtered list) + totals tiles. (f) Admin order detail now shows payment method in Hebrew + an "invoice — coming later" placeholder (invoice provider TBD per user decision). Opus subagent did the slug work; Sonnet translation agent hit the monthly spend limit so translation was done in-session. All gates + Playwright 9/9 green; local `migrate diff` clean. | Run PR-#7 migrations on Supabase at merge; verify image upload on preview. |
| 2026-07-03 | **Three separate user requests, one session.** (1) Applied the 4 pending PR-#7 migrations (`testimonial_role`/`drop_services`/`opening_hours_restructure`/`status_events`) directly to **production** Supabase via the MCP `apply_migration` tool, after first catching and resolving a real discrepancy — the uploaded migration file claimed to be "PR #7" but PR #7's description described unrelated academy-commerce work; verified against the actual `academy-phase-7` branch (which had evolved past its original PR description) before applying, checksums matched exactly. (2) Added add-to-cart + inline quantity stepper directly on shop product cards (`ProductCardCartControl`, sits outside the card's own `Link` so clicks don't navigate) — verified live in browser against a seeded local product catalog. (3) **Phase 8.6 — full admin panel premium redesign** (this session's main task, see Phase 8.6 above for the complete breakdown): 7 groups (A–G), each committed+pushed separately — shell/primitives, data model, Products & Inventory (inline editing), Orders, Course Registrations, Activity/History, polish+security+QA. New verification method established this session and reused across every group: an isolated local Postgres (already used for E2E) plus a **temporary, never-committed** bypass of `requireAdmin()`/middleware auth-check (reverted via `git checkout` — confirmed clean via `git diff` — before every single commit) lets real server actions be exercised end-to-end with Playwright screenshots instead of stopping at typecheck. Caught and fixed one real latent bug (`getProducts()` ordering had no tiebreaker) and one real gap (new `available`/`salePriceAgorot` product fields would have been cosmetic-only without wiring into the public shop + `create-order.ts` pricing — fixed). `security` skill review: 0 Critical/High; added one defense-in-depth fix (runtime `z.boolean()` check on the three toggle actions). All gates (`tsc`/`lint`/`test`/`build`) green throughout. | Run all 5 pending PR-#7 migrations (including today's `product_inventory_and_activity_log`) on production Supabase at merge time; merge/review PR #7. |
| 2026-07-04 | **Phase 11 — PWA, both apps, 3 groups** (user request: "make pwa for the website and for the admin"). Two independent installable apps from one codebase, since `[locale]` and `admin` are separate `<html>` trees: (1) icons (Playwright-rendered from `icon.svg`, admin set color-inverted for home-screen distinguishability) + two static `public/*.webmanifest` files wired via `metadata.manifest`. (2) `serwist`/`@serwist/next` service worker — one compiled `src/app/sw.ts`, registered twice at different scopes (`register:false` + manual `RegisterServiceWorker` per layout), runtime-branches caching strategy off `self.registration.scope` since Cache Storage is origin- not scope-scoped; admin scope is `NetworkOnly` for everything, public scope is `NetworkOnly` for cart/checkout/account/api/auth, `NetworkFirst` for `/shop*`, `StaleWhileRevalidate` for marketing pages. Found+fixed a real bug along the way: next-intl's middleware was 404-ing `/sw.js`/`*.webmanifest` (missing from its static-file exclusion). (3) `security` skill review before close-out found and fixed 2 real gaps that the empirical Playwright pass (which only checked cart/checkout/account/offline) had missed: **High** — `/courses/success`+`/courses/cancel` (force-dynamic, render live enrollment status + payment balance from the DB) weren't in the never-cache list, so they'd have been cached via the broad marketing-pages rule, same PII-in-Cache-Storage risk cart/checkout/account were excluded for — fixed by adding `courses` to the never-cache path list. **Medium** — the middleware's static-asset bypass matched by file extension anywhere in the URL, which would have silently skipped the session check for any future `/admin/*`/`/account/*` route ending in one of those extensions — fixed by scoping the bypass to actual static paths (`icons/`, `images/`, named root files) instead. Re-verified after both fixes: full gates green + live dev-server curl pass (all static assets still 200, `/admin`+`/account` still redirect to `/login`). Known accepted non-security tradeoff (documented, not fixed): the one compiled SW's precache manifest includes both apps' static JS/CSS chunks — architecturally imperfect but not a data-exposure concern (static code only). | Merge/review PR #7 (now includes Phase 11). |
| 2026-07-04 | **Two follow-up requests, one session.** (1) User reported "admin login isn't working" on the Vercel preview. Investigation: production `users` table showed the user's own account (`haim_indyk@icloud.com`) is `role='USER'` (not the bug — by design, only the business account is `ADMIN`), but the actual `restyle.barbershop@outlook.com` admin account ALSO failed — sign-in succeeded (middleware confirmed a valid session, `GET /admin 200` not `307`, per Vercel runtime logs) yet the browser bounced back to `/login`, with a burst of marketing-page prefetches after each attempt and eventual full session loss (`/account` started 307-ing). Root cause: `LoginForm` used `router.push(next)` immediately followed by `router.refresh()` — `next` can point at `/admin`, a completely separate root `<html>` tree from `/login` ([locale] vs admin), and that client-router combo doesn't reliably survive crossing root layouts. Fixed by switching to a hard `window.location.href` navigation, guaranteeing a fresh top-level request through the middleware. Could not reproduce the exact failure on localhost (Vercel's Edge/Serverless split + real network timing aren't replicable there), but verified the new code completes the full login→admin path correctly with a local test admin account; all gates green. (2) User asked to run the migrations discussed earlier — confirmed via `_prisma_migrations` that only `20260703050000_product_inventory_and_activity_log` was still missing (the other 4 from the previous session were already in and checksum-matched), applied it via the MCP `apply_migration` tool with a matching `_prisma_migrations` row (checksum computed from the actual migration file), verified column types/defaults on `products` and RLS-enabled on `activity_log` directly via SQL. Production is now fully caught up — 13/13 migrations applied. | Merge/review PR #7; watch for admin-login confirmation from the user. |
| 2026-07-04 | **Phase 12 — admin shortcut on `/account`** (user request, see Phase 12 above). New `getCurrentUser()` helper reused across the account page instead of duplicating `requireAdmin()`'s role-lookup pattern; conditional `ShieldCheck` + "Admin Panel" `Link` to `/admin`, admin-only. Caught+fixed a real bug while building it: initially used the i18n `Link` (would've produced `/en/admin`, a 404 — `/admin` is outside `[locale]`), swapped for plain `next/link`. `security` skill review: 0 Critical/High (server-rendered check only, no IDOR, `/admin` access still fully gated by the unmodified `requireAdmin()`+middleware). Verified visually with two local seeded test users (ADMIN sees the button, USER doesn't, USER hitting `/admin` directly still gets redirected). All gates green. | Merge/review PR #7 (now includes Phase 12 too). |
| 2026-07-04 | **Phases 13-18 planning (platform-upgrade epic) — analysis completed, then PAUSED by user before implementation.** User requested a Shopify/Stripe-class redesign of account+admin with a mandated multi-agent workflow. Done: (1) scope locked via user answers — single admin stays, curriculum/video skipped, invoices deferred, promotion engine full-but-staged; (2) 4 Opus analysis agents ran in parallel; full reports persisted as implementation briefs in `docs/features/platform-upgrade/`: audit.md (headline gaps: no account shell, no profile-edit action anywhere, categories/courses still giant bulk forms, zero loading states app-wide, topbar re-runs stats every page), data-model.md (additive-only migrations: wishlist/addresses/inventory-ledger/notifications/lifecycle+SEO, all new tables RLS-private), promotion-engine.md (pure evaluator, round-once half-up, largest-remainder allocation, reserve-at-creation + FOR UPDATE + release-on-failure; critical finding: create-order has NO transaction today), ux-spec.md (Hebrew microcopy, bottom tab bar, mono SVG charts, bulk-actions bar, settings tabs); (3) B-vs-C schema conflicts reconciled in the master doc (Promotion+Coupon two-model split for bulk codes, C's semantics authoritative, no chart lib, schema orchestrator-only); (4) ROADMAP Phases 13-18 added. **No implementation code written.** | Resume at Phase 13 (M1): wishlist+addresses migration first, then parallel M1 account-shell + M2 admin-dashboard Sonnet agents (see ⏸️ Phases 13-18 pointer). |
| 2026-07-04 | **Platform-upgrade epic resumed: M1+M2 built, reviewed, merged.** Applied the wishlist+addresses migration (production+local, 0 drift), then ran M1 (account area) and M2 (admin dashboard) as parallel Sonnet agents in isolated git worktrees per the epic's mandated multi-agent workflow. Reviewed both diffs personally before merging — scoped exactly to each brief, no schema/auth files touched by either agent. M2 merged clean on first pass. M1's own gates (tsc/lint/test/build) were green but **live Playwright verification against the local DB caught 3 real bugs invisible to static checks**: a Server→Client RSC boundary crash (bare Lucide icon component passed as a prop — 500 in a live run despite type-checking fine), a day-theme contrast gap on the shared `Card` primitive (its first consumer under the theme-aware public site, having been built for the always-dark admin), and a mobile layout collision between the new bottom tab bar and pre-existing floating contact/accessibility buttons (only visible via measured bounding boxes, not a screenshot). All three fixed, re-verified, and the flagged `ConfirmDialog` duplication was completed as a proper promotion to `components/ui/`. Both worktrees fast-forward merged and pushed; worktrees cleaned up. | Continue with Phase 15 (M3, catalog management) — needs the product/course lifecycle+SEO migration first (data-model.md item 1, not yet applied). |
| 2026-07-06 | **M3 (Phase 15, catalog management) finished — 3 parallel Sonnet streams, all merged.** Per user's "do everything, each with an agent sized to fit" instruction: applied the product/course lifecycle+SEO migration (`publishAt`+6 SEO columns each, additive, RLS untouched) to local+production first, then wired the new `publishAt` gate into every public consumption path (`get-products.ts`, `get-courses.ts`, `create-order.ts`, `create-enrollment.ts` — scheduled/draft items now correctly excluded from storefront listings and direct-purchase attempts, closing a gap where a scheduled product/course could otherwise be bought before its `publishAt`). Then an Opus agent produced a consolidated M3 implementation brief (`docs/features/platform-upgrade/m3-catalog-plan.md`) and 3 Sonnet agents built Products (bulk activate/deactivate/feature/delete + duplicate + preview + SEO/publishAt Sheet section), Categories (table+Sheet replacing the old single giant form, granular CRUD+reorder actions), and Courses (same table+Sheet conversion, Jerusalem⇄UTC `publishAt` helper, DST-verified) in 3 isolated worktrees, each self-verified via tsc/lint/vitest/build plus live-DB sanity checks. Reviewed and merged one at a time (rebase-onto-tip → diff review → gates → merge → push), since all 3 forked before each other's + the migration's commits landed; file sets were disjoint (Products/Categories/Courses don't overlap) so every merge was clean with zero conflicts. Also shipped the **M4 schema** in the same session (migration `20260704020000_promotions_and_coupons`: `Promotion`+`PromotionProduct`+`PromotionCategory`+`Coupon`+`CouponRedemption`, additive `Order`/`OrderItem` discount columns, RLS Pattern B on all 5 new tables) — applied and verified on production, but M4's evaluator/admin UI/checkout integration is not yet built. Final integration check (tsc/lint/test/build) green on the fully-merged tree. | Build M4 (promotion evaluator + admin CRUD + checkout integration); mandatory `security`+`tranzila-payments` skills before it ships. |
| 2026-07-06 | **M4 (Phase 16, promotion engine Stage A) finished — 3 sequenced Sonnet streams (2 parallel + 1 dependent), all merged.** Stream 1: pure evaluator (`src/lib/promotions/evaluate.ts`) matching `promotion-engine.md` exactly (round-once half-up, largest-remainder line allocation, best-single-auto-promo + coupon-on-post-auto-subtotal stacking, orthogonal free shipping) — 28/28 vitest cases with exact agorot values from the spec's worked examples, not just "some discount happened." Stream 2 (parallel): admin CRUD for promotions/coupons — create/edit with per-kind conditional fields, product/category eligibility, bulk coupon-code generation (`crypto.randomBytes`, collision-retry, `skipDuplicates` backstop). Stream 3 (sequenced after Stream 1 merged, since it consumes the evaluator): wired the engine into the real checkout — `create-order.ts` rewritten to wrap order creation in one `db.$transaction`, lock the coupon row `FOR UPDATE` before counting usage, hard-fail the whole checkout on a rejected coupon (no silent full-price fallback), and release the redemption on payment FAILED/amount-mismatch (`handle-payment-result.ts`) and admin order cancellation — never on SUCCEEDED. Both Wave-1 agents hit the Anthropic monthly spend limit mid-task and were resumed via `SendMessage` once the user confirmed the limit had renewed, continuing from their uncommitted worktree state with no lost work. Orchestrator independently re-verified (not just trusting the agents' own reports) the two claims that mattered most: fired 5 simultaneous checkout attempts against a `usageLimit:1` coupon against a live local Postgres using the actual evaluator/fetch/handler code — exactly 1 succeeded, `usedCount` and redemption-row count both ended at exactly 1; then failed that order's payment and confirmed the redemption was released and `usedCount` restored to 0. Ran both `security` and `tranzila-payments` skill reviews before merging Stream 3 (0 Critical/High — a couple of accepted Low-severity notes on coupon-preview error-message granularity and email plus-addressing). All 3 streams individually gated (tsc/lint/test/build) plus one final integration check after all merged (94/94 tests). No customer-facing coupon input in the cart/checkout UI yet — backend is fully wired and ready, flagged as follow-up UI work, not a defect. Also shipped the **M5 schema** in the same session (migration `20260706150000_inventory_events`: `InventoryEvent`+`InventoryReason` enum + `SiteSettings.lowStockThreshold`, RLS Pattern B) while M4 Stream 3 ran in the background. | Build M5 (write-point integration into `handle-payment-result.ts`/`updateProductStock`, admin adjustment dialog + per-product history drawer + low-stock threshold setting). |
| 2026-07-06 | **M5 write points + M6 settings reorg, in parallel (user: "run an agent for M6 meanwhile").** Orchestrator wired M5's two inventory write points directly (payment-adjacent files, done personally rather than delegated, per this session's established rule for checkout-critical code): `updateProductStock` now reads current stock inside its own `$transaction` (reason RESTOCK/MANUAL_ADJUST inferred from delta sign) and `handle-payment-result`'s SUCCEEDED branch (converted from array-form to an interactive transaction) writes one `InventoryEvent` per line with a `resultingStock` snapshot — both independently verified against a live local Postgres with real before/after values, not just tsc/lint. Also shipped the M6 shipping-fee schema piece (`SiteSettings.shippingFeeAgorot`, additive) and personally wired it into `create-order.ts`/`apply-coupon-preview.ts` (`getShippingFeeAgorot()`, DB value with constant fallback) since those are checkout files. Then ran two parallel Sonnet agents for the larger UI pieces, scoped to avoid file overlap: M5's admin UI (adjustment dialog, per-product inventory-history drawer, low-stock-threshold read-wiring into the dashboard KPI/product badges) — still running as of this entry — and M6's settings-page reorganization into a 3-tab IA per `ux-spec.md` §B6, which finished and was reviewed/merged: reused the existing `SiteSettingsForm`/`OpeningHoursForm` unchanged, added a new shipping+inventory tab, introduced a `?tab=`-deep-linkable pill-chip tab shell and an unsaved-changes guard (first of its kind in this codebase). The trickiest design call — making the two new settings fields optional on the *shared* zod schema so the existing contact-info form's unmodified submit doesn't accidentally reset them to defaults — was independently re-verified by the orchestrator with a live-DB round-trip (create with custom values → save the *other* tab only → confirm the custom values survive untouched), not just trusted from the agent's report. | Finish M5's UI stream once it completes; then M6's larger remaining scope (general UX polish pass, final Opus review wave covering architecture/security/a11y/responsive/performance, QA close-out). |
| 2026-07-06 | **M5 (Phase 17) finished — admin UI stream merged.** Stock-adjustment Sheet (set-absolute/delta toggle, both modes computing a final value client-side and calling the one verified `updateProductStock` write point — no parallel mutation action added) and a per-product inventory-history drawer (`getProductInventoryHistory`, read-only, capped at 200 rows since the ledger grows unboundedly, reused the codebase's existing actor-label and delta-coloring conventions instead of inventing new ones). Wired the real DB-backed low-stock threshold (`getLowStockThreshold()`, kept in its own module since `product-schema.ts` is imported by client components and can't pull in `db`) into the dashboard KPI and the product table's badges/filters, replacing the hardcoded constant (kept only as fallback). Diffed to confirm zero changes to the two already-verified write points (`updateProductStock`'s core logic, `handle-payment-result.ts`) — this stream only added a new read-only function alongside them. Full M1-M5 gate (tsc/lint/94 tests/build) green on the merged tree. M5 and M6 (schema/settings-reorg piece) are both now complete; M6's larger remaining scope — general UX polish pass and the final Opus review wave (architecture/security/a11y/responsive/performance) — is what's left of the whole platform-upgrade epic. | M6 remainder: UX polish pass across the platform, then a final multi-angle Opus review wave + QA close-out before the epic itself is marked done. |
| 2026-07-06 | **M6 (Phase 18) finished — epic (Phases 13-18) closed out.** Closed a real gap first: the master acceptance criteria required coupon "preview in cart," which nothing had built yet — a Sonnet agent added a manual apply-button coupon UI to `checkout-form.tsx`, wired to the already-verified `applyCouponPreview`/`createOrder`, without touching any of the already-reviewed backend files. In parallel, ran the epic's own planned "final Opus review wave" as a read-only audit against the accumulated M1-M6 whole (explicitly told not to re-litigate pieces already reviewed individually, e.g. M4's checkout transaction). Result: epic is structurally sound overall (security/money/a11y/RTL all clean — every new mutation across 6 milestones starts with `requireAdmin()`, money stays integer agorot throughout, motion-reduce/RTL-chevron/contrast conventions held). Two High findings, both tracing to acceptance criterion 6 (inventory alerts must surface "on dashboard + bell"): the dashboard's low-stock KPI card linked to `/admin/products?stock=low`, a filter the products table never actually read from `searchParams` (dead deep-link); and the notification bell only ever counted pending orders/enrollments, never low stock, despite the criterion explicitly requiring both surfaces. Fixed both directly (small, well-scoped, not delegated): `ProductsTable` now accepts `initialStockFilter` seeded from `searchParams.stock`; `getTopbarAlertCounts` gained a `lowStockProducts` count threaded through to a new bell group. Also fixed 2 Medium findings the review caught — `getPromotion`'s coupon list and `getPromotionRedemptions` had no `take` cap, the same unbounded-ledger-growth risk the inventory-history query had already guarded against at 200 rows — capped at 200/50 respectively. Fixed 2 of 4 Low polish items (coupon codes forced `dir:ltr` so mixed alphanumeric codes don't reorder in an RTL table cell; promotions nav moved to its own "שיווק" group instead of sharing "קטלוג"); left 2 Low items as documented, deliberate follow-up rather than scope-creeping into them (promotions-table status chips/filtering is a feature addition, not a fix; a chart-tooltip misalignment on horizontal scroll is a minor desktop-hover-only cosmetic issue). Full gate (tsc/lint/94 tests/build) green after every change. **The whole platform-upgrade epic (Phases 13-18) is now complete**: 6 milestones, each built via appropriately-scoped agents (Opus reserved for planning/final-review, Sonnet for implementation, orchestrator handling schema/migrations and the highest-stakes checkout-adjacent code directly), every stream individually gated and diff-reviewed before merge, and every claim that mattered (concurrency/atomicity in particular) independently re-verified against a live database rather than trusted from an agent's own report. | Epic done. Next: whatever the user asks for next — no more platform-upgrade milestones queued. |
| 2026-07-06 | **Shop cart quantity UX (user request) + E2E regression check.** User asked to be able to adjust/cancel quantity with +/- buttons on the product page, matching the catalog card. Found the catalog card (`ProductCardCartControl`) already had this; the product detail page (`AddToCartButton`) and the dedicated `/cart` page did not — both now match: +/- pill control (decrement to 0 removes) plus an explicit trash/remove button. Verified live in a real browser via Playwright (not just gates) in both Hebrew/RTL and English/LTR. Then ran the full existing Playwright E2E suite as a broader regression check after this session's huge changeset — caught and fixed a real environment-setup gotcha along the way (Next's `unstable_cache` data cache persisted a stale empty-products result across a build that ran before test fixtures were seeded — cleared `.next` and reseeded `e2e-product`/`e2e-course`). 7/9 E2E specs pass; the remaining 2 (full checkout/enrollment payment flow) fail only because this sandbox lacks `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`/`ANON_KEY` (`createSupabaseServerClient()` throws inside `createOrder`/`createEnrollment`) — a pre-existing, already-documented user-blocked gap (real or dummy Supabase credentials needed), not a regression from today's change, which only touches client-side cart state. | Phase 10 (Hardening & launch) is what remains platform-wide — most of its items (real domain, real images, Tranzila credentials, Supabase test credentials for full E2E) are user-blocked; flag to user rather than guess at infra decisions. |
| 2026-07-07 | **Phase 19 (premium UX + trust polish epic) finished.** Built directly by the orchestrator (no worktree agents needed — every piece was either the epic's centerpiece or a small, well-scoped fix): header "Personal Area" entry (desktop icon+label pill, mobile promoted to its own full-width button, no longer buried in the plain nav list); course registration premium redesign, which also fixed a real pricing-transparency bug (course detail page previously showed the *full* price as the dominant headline number with the deposit as a small secondary note — now the deposit is the dominant "starting from" number when one applies, full price always shown as a clearly-labeled secondary total, matching the pattern the catalog card already used correctly); `EnrollForm` rebuilt from a bare unstyled HTML form into Card-based plan-selector cards with `react-hook-form` `watch()`-driven active styling, per-plan deposit-vs-total breakdown, and secure-payment trust copy. Then triaged an Opus audit's findings (admin mobile responsiveness + site-wide color contrast): fixed 3 real invisible-in-day-theme contrast bugs (dropdown-menu items, wishlist heart icon, badge neutral tone — the wishlist fix notably used an arbitrary-value class `text-[#fff]` to deliberately bypass the day-theme override selector, since that circle is meant to stay dark in both themes) and the high-leverage mechanical fix — 12 unprefixed `grid grid-cols-2` instances across 6 admin edit Sheets/Dialogs were crushing fields 2-up at 375px, all switched to `grid-cols-1 gap-3 sm:grid-cols-2` matching the pattern already used correctly elsewhere in the codebase. Left 5 Low-severity audit items as documented, deliberate follow-ups (products page bulk-action-bar mobile wrapping, products table's heavy horizontal scroll on mobile, Dialog/Sheet edge-to-edge spacing, muddy-but-legible status badge colors, a handful of already-reviewed-correct color usages) rather than scope-creeping into every Low finding — consistent with how M6's audit wave was closed out. All contrast fixes live-verified via Playwright with explicit theme/locale forcing (Playwright's default `colorScheme` is light and default locale isn't Hebrew — both must be forced explicitly, a gotcha rediscovered this session) and `getComputedStyle()` reads, not screenshots alone. Full gate (tsc/lint/94 tests/build) green after every commit. | Phase 10 (Hardening & launch) remains the only queued platform-wide work, mostly user-blocked (real domain/images, Tranzila credentials, Supabase test credentials for full E2E). |
